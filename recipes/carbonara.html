			There’s something truly magical about a perfect plate of Carbonara — the
			way the creamy sauce wraps around each strand of pasta, the aroma of
			crispy guanciale, and the sharp bite of Pecorino Romano. This dish

		<h2>Ingredients (for 2 servings)</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>200g (7 oz) spaghetti</li>
			<li>100g (3.5 oz) guanciale (or pancetta, if unavailable)</li>
			<li>2 large eggs</li>
			<li>100g (1 cup) Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated</li>
			<li>Salt, to taste</li>
			<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Prepare the ingredients.</b>
				<p>
					Start by bringing a pot of salted water to a boil. While you wait, cut
					the guanciale into thin strips and grate the Pecorino Romano until
					fine and fluffy.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Cook the guanciale.</b>
				<p>
					In a large pan, cook the guanciale over medium heat until it becomes
					crispy and golden, releasing its flavorful fat. Turn off the heat and
					let it rest while the pasta cooks.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Cook the pasta.</b>
				<p>
					Drop the linguine into the boiling water and cook until al dente.
					Before draining, remember to save a small cup of the starchy pasta
					water: it’s the secret to achieving that creamy texture.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Bring it all together.</b>
				<p>
					Add the drained pasta to the pan with the guanciale and toss well.
					Remove from the heat, then pour in the egg mixture, stirring quickly
					so the heat of the pasta gently cooks the eggs without scrambling
					them. Add a splash of pasta water if needed to reach a silky
					consistency.

				<b>Cook the guanciale.</b>
				<p>
					In a large pan, cook the guanciale over medium heat until it becomes
					crispy and golden, releasing its flavorful fat. Turn off the heat and
					let it rest while the pasta cooks.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Serve and enjoy.</b>
				<p>
					Plate immediately, top with extra Pecorino and black pepper, and enjoy
					this timeless Roman classic — comforting, rich, and made with just a
					few humble ingredients.
