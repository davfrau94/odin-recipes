			There’s an elegance in simplicity — and the "Risotto allo Zafferano"
			captures that perfectly. Creamy, golden, and delicately perfumed, this
			dish is a celebration of balance: few ingredients, yet deeply satisfying.
			Originating from Milan, it’s a symbol of northern Italian cuisine and the
			art of transforming the humble rice grain into something extraordinary.

		<h2>Ingredients (serves 2-3)</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>200g (1 cup) Arborio or Carnaroli rice</li>
			<li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
			<li>40g (3 tbsp) butter</li>
			<li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
			<li>100ml (⅓ cup) dry white wine</li>
			<li>About 700ml (3 cups) hot vegetable or chicken broth</li>
			<li>1 packet (about 0.15g) saffron threads or powder</li>
			<li>40g (⅓ cup) grated Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
			<li>Salt, to taste</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Prepare the saffron</b>
				<p>
					Warm a small cup of broth and dissolve the saffron in it, letting it
					infuse while you start the risotto. This helps release its color and
					aroma.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Sauté the onion.</b>
				<p>
					In a wide pan, heat the olive oil and half the butter over medium
					heat. Add the chopped onion and cook slowly until soft and
					translucent, without letting it brown.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Toast the rice.</b>
				<p>
					Add the rice to the pan and stir for about 2 minutes, coating each
					grain in the fat until it becomes slightly translucent at the edges.
					This step locks in the starch — the secret to a creamy risotto.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Deglaze with wine.</b>
				<p>
					Pour in the white wine and let it evaporate completely, stirring
					gently.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Cook the risotto.</b>
				<p>
					Begin adding the hot broth, one ladle at a time, stirring often. Wait
					until the liquid is almost absorbed before adding the next ladle.
					Continue for about 15–18 minutes, until the rice is creamy and al
					dente.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Add the saffron.</b>
				<p>
					Halfway through cooking, pour in the saffron-infused broth and stir
					well. Watch as the rice turns beautifully golden and aromatic.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Mantecare (the final touch).</b>
				<p>
					Remove the pan from the heat. Add the remaining butter and Parmigiano
					Reggiano. Stir vigorously to create a rich, velvety texture. Adjust
					salt if needed.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Serve.</b>
				<p>
					Let the risotto rest for a minute, then plate it gently. Serve warm,
					spreading it slightly on the plate as tradition suggests — the perfect
					balance of creaminess and elegance.
				</p>
