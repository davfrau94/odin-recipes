			béchamel, and melted cheese come together in perfect harmony. It’s a labor

		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Prepare the ragù.</b>
				<p>
					In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add onion,
					carrot, and celery, and sauté until soft and fragrant. Add the ground
					meats and cook until browned, breaking them apart with a spoon. Pour
					in the red wine and let it evaporate completely. Stir in the crushed
					tomatoes, season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, then let it simmer
					gently for at least 45 minutes — the longer, the better.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Make the béchamel sauce.</b>
				<p>
					In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Stir in the
					flour and cook for a minute until smooth. Gradually add the warm milk
					while whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Continue stirring until the
					sauce thickens, then season with salt and a touch of nutmeg.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Assemble the lasagna.</b>
				<p>
					Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). In a baking dish, spread a thin
					layer of béchamel, followed by a layer of pasta sheets. Add a layer of
					ragù, a spoonful of béchamel, and a sprinkle of Parmigiano. Repeat the
					layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with béchamel and
					plenty of Parmigiano on top.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Bake.</b>
				<p>
					Cover loosely with foil and bake for 25 minutes, then remove the foil
					and bake for another 10–15 minutes, until golden and bubbling.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Rest and serve.</b>
				<p>
					Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before slicing — it helps the
					layers settle and makes each serving perfect. Serve warm, and enjoy
					the deep, comforting flavors of this Italian classic.
